# CMSIS-Toolbox Examples for Embedded World paper
## !!! This repository is not actively maintained and is read-only !!! 
This repository contains examples for Embedded World 2024 paper:
  [**Simplifying the integration of software components in modern microcontroller systems**](paper.md)

The examples can work with two FPGA platforms from Arm®:

- Arm MPS2/MPS2+ FPGA
- Arm MPS3 FPGA (With Cortex-M55 FPGA image AN552 and fewer number of examples)

## Setup / installation

This repository contains the following external submodules:

These benchmarks are used as project examples to illustrate how csolution project format and CMSIS-Toolbox can be deployed.

To check out the repository:

```
> git clone https://github.com/Arm-Examples/EW2024_CMSIS-Toolbox

In each of the example directories, there is a makefile and a batch file to help you to go through different steps.

- Before using the makefile, you can edit the file to update the TOOLCHAIN setting based on your preference. Alternatively you can override the TOOLCHAIN setting when involving make in the command line.
- Before using the batch file, please edit the TOOLCHAIN setting based on your preference.

The file [vcpkg-configuration.json](./vcpkg-configuration.json) is for Arm Keil Studio Pack to download toolchains.
More information about Arm Keil Studio Pack can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack).

## Limitations

Please note that the examples currently have the following limitations:

- When using the makefiles the first time to download CMSIS-PACK, the tool might report an error after downloading the pack and stop. This is because some of the packs are not aware of CMSIS-CORE in the CMSIS version 6. However, the projects are compatible with CMSIS 6 and you can ignore the error(s) and just rerun the make to compile the projects. 
- One of the tests in CoreMark-Pro (Zip-test) in Example 5 contains C source file that is not compatible to modern C standard and therefore cannot be compiled with IAR toolchain. As a result this test is disabled.
- When using IAR EWARM debugger with Cortex-M55/Cortex-M85 FPGA, please select JTAG debug protocol and the connection speed need to be set to 24MHz or lower.
- The makefiles have not been tested with IAR Build Tools for Arm. However, the projects have been tested with IAR EWARM toolchain.

## Disclaimers

- CoreMark and CoreMark-Pro are benchmarks from SPEC® Embedded Group (formerly EEMBC®) and are not properties of Arm.
- The compilation options for CoreMark and CoreMark-Pro used in these examples have not been tested for best performance.
